    <h2 id="descriptionTitle">Description:</h2>
    <p id="description">Add some color to your slow cooker chicken and veggies, by browning the chicken skin beforehand. Not only is it more appetizing, it tastes better, too. Prep all the veggies, load them into the cooker, and place the browned chicken on top. No need to add any liquid, either, as everything slow roasts in the pot! Serve with a salad and some bread to complete the menu.</p>
